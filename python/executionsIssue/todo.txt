Test that executions are being returned:

1. If Trades windows in TWS is closed
2. If Trades window in TWS is active
3. If Show Trades for was unchanged
4. If Show Trades for has been altered
5. If order type affects result of execution
6. If ExecutionEnd endpoint is triggered when order type is BAG and order
  was placed the day before
7. On what occasion ExecutionEnd endpoint is not being triggered
8. If executionFilter somehow affect the output 

Placing new orders and further execution of those orders affects reqExecutions() 

Expected behavior: code hangs, execDetailsEnd() never triggered

1. Place new orders, check if they got executed via TWS
2. Call reqExecutions() from separate script


New plan:

1. Place orders
2. Call reqExecutions()
3. Place more orders after the executions to check if the code is unresponsive.

Above results in all executions returned according to Show Trades for field in 
Classic TWS

reqExecutions() will only return executions if orders were placed during the execution of the 
script?
